# Show the Battery Level and External IP Address in Piracer OLED

### Test Code ["Piracer_OLED" Folder](https://github.com/Ho-mmd/DES_Project2/tree/main/Piracer_OLED)
##### - oled.py: Show the IP address in Piracer OLED
##### - controller_oled.py: Show the IP address and Battery level in Piracer OLED with using controller

### Calculate Battery Level

#### 1. Go to manufactured company of battery what you using
##### Ex) [Murata_Lithium Ion](https://www.murata.com/en-us/products/batteries/cylindrical)
#### 2. Get the datasheet about battery (You can see the table or graph about battery)
